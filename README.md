# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is for learning purposes where I implement various algorithms and data structures

## What programming language should I use?

I don't always agree with "Just pick a programming language that you're most familiar with". I think for the most part, 
it's about using a general-purpose programming language that most people (aka your interviewer) will know and understand.

General-purpose programming langauges also have much more support and resources to learn from to grow and get better at problem solving. A few examples:
1. On Leetcode, almost all the offical and non-offical solutions are either written in Java, Python and C++ with other languages such as JavaScript and Go trailing very behind. 
2. Solutions in Cracking the Coding Interview are written in Java.
3. Elements of Programming Interviews has three editions - Java, Python and C++.
4. The top algorithm and data structure courses in the world are taught in a general-purpose programming language i.e. MIT 6.006 (Python), Algorithms by Princeton University (Java), UC Berkeley CS61B (Java)

Hopefully by now you can see the trend. If you want to start learning algorithms and data structures, it may in your best interest to pick up one of these languages instead of taking a long shot with languages like PHP which has syntax that may not be generally familar and which lacks support in helping you learn.

I don't really know why I felt like I needed to write this, but hopefully it's useful for anyone just starting out in learning algorithms and data structures.
