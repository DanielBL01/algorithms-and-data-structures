# Common sorting algorithms
- Heapsort
- Merge sort
- Quicksort
- Insertion sort

## Useful tips

- The fastest time complexity for sorting is O(n log n).
- Naive sorting algorithms run in O(n^2) time complexity.
- A well-implemented quicksort is usually the best choice for sorting with O(1) space complexity.
- For short arrays i.e. n < 10, insertion sort is easier to code and faster than other superior sorting algorithms such as quicksort.

## Sorting libraries

- To sort an array: Arrays.sort(A) is O(n log n) where n is the length of the array.
